    <!--Well, oral presentation requires comprehensive abilities, so I definitely consider it better for students.
    For e.g. when I did a presentation last time, I thought through the form of the presentation in order to make
    it more contagious to the audience, like, I added some sound and light effects to those slides, which is not
    required in the process of writing a paper in isolation. What’s more, I had a one-on-one discussion with my
    professor to perfect my content, which was a good opportunity to exercise my communication skills, also a good
    chance to leave a good impression on the professor. Speaking in front of a large audience once was my weak point,
    however, after my first attempt, it was never a problem to me.-->

    <!--Advertisements absolutely are reflections of social changes.-->
    <!--To be specific, I can see the increase of life quality. For e.g. if I wanted to buy a shampoo in the past
    in China, there were only few brands I could choose from; yet today, thousands of commercials showing all sorts
     of brands keep popping up on the TV screen, I can choose whatever I want based on my personal need.-->
    <!--Also, there was hardly any public-interest advertisement on TV or magazines; however, if I take a close
    look at today’s mass media in China, I can see various public-interest ads calling for people to protect the
    environment. -->

    <!--I agree with this statement that reading novels is far more inciting than watching movies. I was often
    hooked by those ups and downs in the crime novels, and always obsessed with the blue prints that science
    fictions depict for us. For e.g. I recently read a novel written by a Japanese writer, it’s really a good
    exercise for my imagination, it offers more space for me to visualize all the scenes than the movie does, I
    was deeply involved in it, and really got great pleasure.-->
    <!--Besides, the director of a movie often uses a lot of methods to narrow down the interpretation of the
    figures, however, in a novel, you have the freedom to interpret them from your own perspective.-->

    <!--I think parents have the responsibility to lead their children to watch TV, because TV programs are filled
     with violence and contents which are not suitable for children, and kids are extremely easy to be misled by
     those contents. For e.g. if they are continuously exposed to the violence, they will potentially bully other
     kids; if they overly watch advertisements of junk food, they may give up the healthy diets that are beneficial
      for them, turning to relying on deep-fried food. Only with the supervision of the parents, can they be
      carefully controlled, or protected from the harmful programs, because adults are mature enough to help them
      tell right from wrong. -->

    <!--Cell phones touch all aspects of our lives, but from my standpoint, negative effects outweigh the positive
     effects.-->
    <!--Frist, cell phones provide people with a platform to show off their own life, for e.g. the wealthy people
    often post the pictures of their beautiful selfies or luxury goods, creating a pretty surface atmosphere among
    the society.-->
    <!--In addition, youngsters are being highly distracted from their study by the meaningless and misleading
    information, the apps and games on the cell phones are stealing time away from them, and they can’t focus on
    what they mean to be doing and are becoming increasingly fickle. -->

    <!--I totally disagree with the statement, because for older doctors, as they are getting old, they may have
    some physical problems, like trembling hands, poor eyesight, they can't do operations anymore. Without
    exposing themselves to thousands of patients, they'll become outdated soon, because medical technology keeps
    moving forward, every year , new machines, new ways of diagnosing diseases keep emerging, older doctors would
    fail to adapt to them.-->
    <!--Besides, diagnosis nowadays is not based on experience anymore, the process has been digitalized, and
    accurately quantified, so the experience the old doctors acquired in the past would soon become futile in
    today's social context. -->

    <!--I would definitely donate my money into community charity. Because changing people’s lives can bring me
    the sense of accomplishment. Building a small second-hand book library is my dream, since people prefer reading
     books on electronic devices,  piles of paper books must be left on their book shelves which they can actually
     share with other community members, so the library can become a place where people share reading experiences,
     enjoying face to face communications and relax, which can contribute to the harmony of the community and help
     strengthen the relationship between them. -->

    <!--I think the most effective way is the regulations released by the government. Firstly, through the
    enforcement of the law, the environment would be improved during a short period. For e.g. if the government
    prohibits the use of private cars, no one will dare to drive , because if they violate the law ,they would have
    to pay high price, the air quality would be greatly enhanced. While, environment protection organizations have
    relatively limited power, so the businesses would ignore their voice; as for individuals, they are often
    self-serving, and not able to discipline themselves if they get some benefits from doing things that are
    actually hurting the environment.-->

    <!--Games perform multiple functions for adults and of course are very important. Firstly, playing games is a
    kind of instinct existing in human genes, for e.g. I myself play video games every day, beyond the boundary of
    reality, I turn myself into romantic hero, which is extremely stress-free. Also, for the older adults, games
    bring them back to the innocence, entertain them at intervals of heavy work schedule, thus beneficial for their
    mental health. You know, sometimes I teach my parents how to play games, they appear to be pretty joyful when
    indulging themselves into games. For the seniors, playing games can especially help exercise their minds,
    prevent the degeneration of memory.-->

    <!--The person I'd like to talk with most is my friend Jennifer. she is really an excellent story teller.
    Whenever we met, she always brought me some interesting stories which might be something happened with my other
    friends, or celebrity gossip. The way she tells stories is really unique and dramatic, her facial expressions
    and tones and hand gestures often crack me up. I can't help being attracted by her magnetic and optimistic
    personality. Besides, sometimes we also talked about new life styles or eye-opening new technologies, which
    indeed expanded my horizons. Talking with Jennifer brings me pleasure and positive energy, also some inspiration
    about life, so that's why I like to talk with her most.-->

    <!--My sister is an interesting person whose personality is totally different from mine. She was brought up in
    America, and quite straightforward when dealing with relationships. For e.g. when she has different opinions
    with others, she often voices out her ideas directly, and tries to persuade others with convincing words. While
    as for me, I was raised up in a traditional Chinese family, so under the influence of Chinese culture, I am
    quite indirect and reserved when I’m at odds with others. Usually, I instinctively avoid conflict, whereas my
    sister is really good at looking for it. -->

    <!--When working in a team, I prefer people who are easy to communicate with, because you know in teamwork,
    when facing difficulties, we need to sit together and discuss how to overcome them, with an easygoing co-worker,
    there wouldn’t be any walls set up between us , so problems would be solved efficiently.-->
    <!--Additionally, a good co-worker should dare to express disagreement when making critical decisions; he
    shouldn’t only be an echo-chamber with me, but an incisive person who can provide some constructive
    suggestions to the whole team. -->

    <!--For me, a good parent should first be tolerant, so the children won’t fear being blamed too much for
    committing small mistakes, thus the loose atmosphere in the family allows children to be bold enough to explore
    what they are curious about. For e.g. I remember when I took the clock apart, my father didn’t scold me,
    which cultivated my interest in mechanism .-->
    <!--Besides, a good parent should have sharp eyes to discover the greatness and uniqueness in their children.
    For e.g. if not for the support and cultivation from his father, the well-known pianist Lang Lang wouldn’t
    have achieved today’s success.-->
